                <p>I created this test tracking site to show my experiences and skills on web page development and analyzing</p>
                <p>The page is developed by using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript</p>
                <p>Every code snippet is written by my own</p>

            <div class="faq">

                <p class="question">How you decided on your approach before beginning to write any code?</p>
                <p class="answer">Before I began coding, I looked over the steps and the wireframe and made some notices on a white paper. 
    On the white paper, I develop the web page by using pseudo code to see the bottleneck and to think about the functions on the web page.</p>
                
                <p class="question">How you handled transitioning from mobile to desktop and why you chose to do it like that?</p>
                <p class="answer">After creating the mobile version of the web page, I looked on the desktop version to see the differences. I decide to use a grid on the main area on the web page to have a constantly working layout nevermind with which device the page will use. I only have had to create a special @media query for the main, the header, the position of the brand, the menu icon, and the nav ul to have the same look of the web page on each device.</p>

                <p class="question">What is the general structure/positioning of the elements?</p>
                <p class="answer">To not to play too much with padding or margin, I decided to use flexboxes on the CSS part, to have any time the same position for the elements never mind on which device the web page wants to be used.</p>

                <p class="question">How would you ensure the page remains the same across differently sizes mobile devices?</p>
                <p class="answer">I like to work with flexboxes instead of floating elements. For the main area, I used a grid to have on all devices the same size of the content and not to play with a bunch of different media queries.</p>

                <p class="question">What you have considered to cater for landscape mobile versions.</p>
                <p class="answer">To get the best SEO, I want to have a fast loading web page because of Google and other search engines which are looking for fast web pages on the search results. I chose not to use too much JavaScript to get the fastest web page version.
Every transition and transformation was created by using CSS. Especially, on mobile devices is a fast loading time important.</p>
                
                <p class="question">Briefly describe what you would have done for a tablet version.</p>
                <p class="answer">The tablet version is the same as the mobile version. The mobile version works until to a screen size of 1024px.</p>

                <p class="question">How you handled the functionality for clicking on the hamburger or tabs to change game “page”.</p>
                <p class="answer">The hamburger icon is a HTML code „&#9776;“ with a checkbox behind to trigger the click on the menu icon. By using the CSS pseudo class „checked“ I have the same effect like to use a function or an if else statement in JavaScript.</p>

                <p class="question">State approximate time taken to complete the test.</p>
                <p class="answer">I worked around 3 to 4 business days.</p>

                <p class="question">Name some ways in which performance of the page can be enhanced.</p>
                <p class="answer">I am not sure there is a possibility to enhance the performance of the web page. I guess it's not possible to enhance the web page performance further because I didn’t use any JavaScript code.</p>
                
                <p class="question">Things you would have done differently if you had more time</p>
                <p class="answer">If I had more time, I would do the design much more better and look more on the details as well as I would play a bit more with CSS elements on the desktop version, to have more moving on the web page.</p>

                <p class="question">What is important and which code I have already created on a different project to use this code and only to change the code to the required</p>
                <p class="answer">I belive one part was the verious approaches to get the menue in a movement, at the end I deceidet to do it by using CSS transition. Another part was the tracking of AdBlocker user. Through GTM I send a function which looks for a truthy or falsy statement and send the result to the conected Google Analytics - Window.showAds = true</p>
